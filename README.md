# Plant-Watering-System
# 
Utilizes an Arduino UNO board and a moisture sensor to automate plant watering based on programmed soil moisture thresholds. Includes a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows manual control of the water pump, regardless of soil moisture levels. The system also features a physical button on the board for activating the pump manually. Additionally, the GUI displays a real-time graph of moisture sensor data.
